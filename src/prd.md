# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe Game PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide a challenging and visually engaging 3D version of the classic tic-tac-toe game that exercises spatial thinking.
- **Success Indicators**: Players can easily understand the 3D grid, complete games, and want to play again.
- **Experience Qualities**: Intuitive, Elegant, Immersive

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (making strategic moves in the game)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Traditional tic-tac-toe is too simple and predictable. A 3D version adds complexity and strategic depth.
- **User Context**: Users will engage during short breaks or gaming sessions, looking for mental stimulation.
- **Critical Path**: User arrives → understands 3D board → makes moves → sees win/tie outcome → starts new game
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. First interaction with the 3D board (rotating/understanding)
  2. Placing a marble and seeing the visual feedback
  3. Recognizing a winning pattern in 3D space

## Essential Features
1. **3D Game Board**
   - Functionality: An interactive 3×3×3 cube made of 27 cells
   - Purpose: Provides the playing field for the 3D game
   - Success criteria: Users can easily visualize and understand the 3D space
   
2. **Game State Management**
   - Functionality: Tracks player turns, board state, and win conditions
   - Purpose: Enforces game rules and determines outcomes
   - Success criteria: Accurately detects all 49 possible win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals across planes)

3. **Interactive Controls**
   - Functionality: Ability to rotate the cube and select cells
   - Purpose: Allows players to view the board from multiple angles and make moves
   - Success criteria: Intuitive controls that feel natural and responsive

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Functionality: Clear indication of whose turn it is, winning lines, and game status
   - Purpose: Keeps players informed of the game state
   - Success criteria: Players always understand the current state of the game

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Curiosity, satisfaction, light competition
- **Design Personality**: Modern, elegant with a playful touch
- **Visual Metaphors**: Floating crystals/marbles in space, clean geometric structures
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with rich 3D visualization

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Complementary with dark background
- **Primary Color**: Deep indigo (#3730a3) - represents depth and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft slate (#94a3b8) for the board structure
- **Accent Colors**: Vibrant ruby (#e11d48) for Player 1, Cyan blue (#0891b2) for Player 2
- **Color Psychology**: The contrast between warm red and cool blue creates visual tension and competition
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between marbles and board, distinct colors for colorblind users
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (#0f172a) / Foreground (white #ffffff): High contrast for main text
  - Card (#1e293b) / Card-foreground (#f8fafc): Clean readable text on UI elements
  - Primary (#3730a3) / Primary-foreground (#ffffff): Visible button text
  - Secondary (#94a3b8) / Secondary-foreground (#f1f5f9): Subtle but readable
  - Accent (#8b5cf6) / Accent-foreground (#ffffff): Highlight elements with clear text

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Clean sans-serif for UI elements with slightly rounded geometric font for game title
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings with lighter body text
- **Font Personality**: Modern, crisp, approachable
- **Readability Focus**: Large, clear labels for game status
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and weight throughout the interface
- **Which fonts**: 'Space Grotesk' for headings, 'Inter' for body text
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts highly legible at various sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: 3D board as central focus with controls and status framing it
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to emphasize the 3D board and reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Centered main content with sidebar for game controls and history
- **Responsive Approach**: Collapse sidebar on mobile, adjust 3D board size based on viewport
- **Content Density**: Low density to focus attention on the game board

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth rotations to help visualize 3D space
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary animation for board rotation, secondary for marble placement
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle transitions between game states, more pronounced for wins

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for game info, buttons for controls, dialog for game end
- **Component Customization**: Rounded elements to match the marble theme
- **Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Simple geometric icons for rotation and game controls
- **Component Hierarchy**: Game board (primary), control panel (secondary), status info (tertiary)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4-point grid spacing system
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout for mobile with touch-optimized controls

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent styling
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, and component styling
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- **Brand Alignment**: Modern, clean aesthetic with a focus on the 3D visualization

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Difficulty understanding 3D win patterns
- **Edge Case Handling**: Provide hints system for possible winning moves
- **Technical Constraints**: Optimize 3D rendering for lower-end devices

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Potential for additional game board sizes (4×4×4)
- **Testing Focus**: User understanding of 3D navigation
- **Critical Questions**: How intuitive is the 3D visualization for users not familiar with 3D interfaces?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely blends modern web capabilities (3D rendering) with a classic game concept
- We assume users will have the patience to learn the 3D interface
- Adding subtle guides to help visualize winning lines would make this solution exceptional
